# Akaash ‚Äî Applied AI Engineer (Production GenAI)

I design and maintain **AI platforms that consultants use every single day**.  
These systems are built to handle large client datasets, run reliably for many users at once, and give our teams safe, auditable outputs. The results: **8√ó faster data processing**, **project timelines reduced from months to days**, and adoption across **50+ enterprise clients worldwide**.

- **AI Procurement Toolkit**  
  A suite of tools that helps consultants clean and organize massive amounts of client procurement data. It can process half a million records in about two hours, and has been deployed across 50+ global clients.  
  Consultants now rely on it to automatically match and harmonize supplier names, materials, and spend categories.
  <b>Results:<b> Saved thousands of manual hours and ensuring consistent outputs every time.

- **Supplier Benchmarking Platform**  
  A full-stack web application that lets consultants search and compare suppliers in seconds. Instead of manually pulling data from spreadsheets, they can use a React dashboard to type natural-language queries (e.g. ‚Äúshow me top logistics suppliers in Europe‚Äù), which the system corrects and runs against an optimized SQL database. It also generates supplier profiles with real-time news, SWOT analysis, and benchmarks. This cut the time needed to prepare client-ready supplier lists to **one-third** of the old process.

- **Agentic AI Prototypes**  
  I‚Äôve built ‚Äúagentic‚Äù systems ‚Äî AI that can plan, execute, and adapt like a junior consultant. For example, I designed an on-premise AI agent for a $200B retailer that reviews inventory purchases, adapts to changing approval rules, and works with evolving data schemas.  
  I also created pipelines that extract product specifications from messy, unstructured spend data.
  <b>Results:<b> Unlocked new ways for teams to aggregate and analyze information.

- **Leadership & Reliability**  
  Beyond building, I ensure these platforms improve every week: monitoring performance, adding safeguards, and running evaluations. I frequently demo our work to Firm Partners and client executives, and I document outcomes so that our roadmap stays aligned with business needs.  

  My guiding principle is build fast and experiment quickly, but know when to slow down to build systems that are reliable, observable, and reversible if things go wrong.
