### Building Products for Users

I'm an Applied AI Engineer at Kearney.
<br>
I've been a founding member in building out Applied AI tech that services our consulting practice.
<br>
As an early adopter in building out Gen AI applications, we have gone from building MVPs to Live in Production Gen AI workflows and Applications in Procurement, Research and Automation

My Day to Day work includes:
- Building Complex Agentic Architectures with the aim of emulating knowledge work done by Consultants
- Providing innovative AI enabled ways of improving Quality of Life and Quality of Work for Consultants
- Managing the upkeep and ensuring week on week improvements to our software architecture.

Gen AI is a revolutionary field and has completely changed the way we do work here in my practice - so I strive to consistently push the needle in terms of what we can do with technology.
